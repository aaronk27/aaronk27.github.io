My methods of understanding life include computer science, finance, history and philosophy. All of these subjects go hand in hand. Even with this curiosity I know that life is short and I must pick and choose what is important to. Be that spending time with family and friends or working with people I have complete faith in. The people around me can make or break my life, luckily I have an incredibly loving and supportive network of people who make my life worth living.

Spending time alone is another vector of life, having discpline to keep with your own promises is difficult. This aspect of life is challenging for everyone but it is essential to keep on your path. I find that exercising is an extremely important part of life, in my earlier years I did not value it as much for my mental health but with time I have realized that whenever I am not consistently excerising my body eventually my mind will start too weaken aswell. This disclipine while alone helps make every minute, nay every second more enjoyable because I know exactly what I want and how to get it. This doesn't mean that I am always in a good state of mind but It is in the action of trying to better myself that I understand will compound over the years of my life.
