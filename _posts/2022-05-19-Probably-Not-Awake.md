You’re probably not awake but I’d like to tell you a story. See I’ve had some unfortunate luck in my 18 years of surviving. Somewhere down the line I lost myself and I never could find the piece that felt missing. I’ve read countless books but the knowledge only brought me more suffering. I threw myself into my school work and turned my heart off. For a while I felt numb. The numbness didn’t beat the pain. I was paralyzed about 6 years ago on June 4th, 2016. I went from bedridden to a wheelchair to walking normally again. I inspired my peers. To be honest I never felt very inspired by myself. I never understood why people had so much hope in me. A lot of times I just felt empty. You may think or say that I should see a psychologist about it, I would have to agree. The only issue is I know they could never help me even in the slightest, I know that because I’ve tried. Maybe medication could help but the emptiness I speak of is more of an abstract philosophical idea. The idea of self and how the inner self is forgotten and hidden away so no one knows what you really feel. Your vices can hide the pain but behind every mask  is a broken soul. How does one fix the soul? How does one reach nirvana? True happiness? I have no clue but so far I found that helping others and being kind brings back a sense of peace in the turmoil of life. I have lost a lot but I feel it is of the utmost importance to still fight, because who else will?
