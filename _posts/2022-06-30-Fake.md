I rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I'm not

I have been fake for a lot of my life
That's because I had to fill in the shoes that everyone else wanted me to wear
I never fit
but I had to try and fit in
 I wish I had more confidence in myself
Instead I had to build defence mechanicisms to try and cope
I made myself into the clown

Just to make it hurt a little bit less

When someone was mean I took it as a joke
but no more
Because they mean what they say
even when they act like they don't

They know it hurts me but they act ignorant 
They don't respect me

I always wanted more from life
I always wanted
but I never needed
now I'm going to change up my act

I need this in my life
I need to be the best me
for me

I have a plan in my heart
and I will follow it to the ends of earth
I won't stop till what I say comes true
because I believe in it
I have conviction in it

They don't believe like I do
They don't have faith like I do

Is it weird that I keep forgetting that I am alive?
Is it weird that I rather be in my dreams than alive?
Is it weird that I don't know if I am dreaming or sleeping?

Sometimes it's hard to tell 
What happens when you never wake up?
What happens when you are forever locked away in your dreams?

I need to stop
I have to wake up from my nightmares and accept reality 

Do I have the courage to wake up and see my demons in the eyes?
Do I have the ability to open my heart and soul to the world?
Or will I lock myself up 
never to be seen
