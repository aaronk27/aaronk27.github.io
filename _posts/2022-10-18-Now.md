when I was a kid I had an idea that when you died you, your now
The moment, the very last moment 
you would  be frozen in it
right before the end you saw the beginning once more 
your last and first moment colliding together to form your now

even in nothingness you will have now
even if you're blind deaf and dumb you will have now

It does not matter who you are what you stand for, what culture you have. What religion you believe in. 
It does not matter, not because I do not care for your ideas 
but becausse it should not matter who you are.
I will still be here with you now
you are still here with me now
no matter what 
Now will connect us
and on a human level 
that is all that matters
