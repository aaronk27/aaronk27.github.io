Time is passing me by each and every day. Even though I feel like I cannot keep up with others
I have something they do not 
and that is my heart
I had lost my heart for a long time
I had lost my hope for a long time
but now I have regained the ability to see
to see in the darkness of my own cavities and feel who I am
to truly understand myself
How did I achieve this?
I realized that even though I may want not like my life 
or I may feel that life is pointless and arbitrary and meaningless

but I decide how I percieve my future 
I decide how I see the world around me
It is my choice
it will always be my choice
and when they ask me why I have a smile on my face
I will ask them
Why they do not?

See I have been so unhappy because I was not capable of realizing who
I am
I thought I was a fraud when in reality I am not
I am not an imposter
I am supposed to be here
I am supposed to exist on the same plain as the people around me
I am neither above nor below them
even if they try to put me in these boxes
it is not something that should contain me
nothing can contain the creavity of someone who truly learns how to control themselves and their emotions
I am not in full control
but I understand 
that I will never be in “full” control
there are simply too many moving parts and to try and dictate the positioning of everything drove me mad
this view threw me into the deepest pits of hell
but now I realize that although I may be In a sense “Helpless”
helpless to the world around me
I will not let these quams stop me from being my true self
and that is simply
 ME
 :)
 
 I hope that you unlock the ability to see into your own soul and feel the despair that I once did
 because than you will be one step closer to solving your own puzzle 
 I wish you luck
 and I hope you find peace
