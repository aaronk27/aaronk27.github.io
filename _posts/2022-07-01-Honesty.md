I have so much hate in my heart, I do not appreicate what God has given me. I also have a fire in my heart, an anger that can not be stopped
I am so angry with the world
but mostly with myself
I am not perfect by any means
but I am willing to go
I am willing to see
I will sacrifice
For the chance to become a beacon 
a beacon of light in these dark times
I want to be that for people
but I can't even be that for myself
I am a lost boy trying to find his way back home

I am nothing 
I will remain as nothing
Please save me
I beg 
I plead
I need a hero 
but I know in my heart that I am the only hero in my story
The only person who can save me
is me
if your in there 
you have to take control
and set yourself free


I have lost friends
and family

I have lost many battles
but I have many more to come

I am scared
but my fear drives me forward
There is nothing behind me
I am the only thing left backing me

My lowest low
but I think it is all apart of the grand plan

It all adds up to something
I know my mistakes 
I will be better 
I will be reforged into something greater

In the fires we will be purged
We will change


There are fires in us all
We just choose not to use them
I wish I could open your heart and show you what you're missing
but this is a journey you must undertake on your own
Please, you may forget me
but do not forget my words
You must find the piece that is missing
Even if you lose everything in search 
You will gain something invaluable
true freedom
Freedom from your artifical self
Freedom from the hatred of yourself
and peace in the turmoil

No one can give that to you
You can only find it by being yourself

Take off the mask and use your voice
The world needs you to speak

purify the murky waters

Bring clarity and<strong> honesty <strong>
