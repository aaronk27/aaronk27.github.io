D:4 (I roll a dice in the morning sometimes)

<strong> Ain't it funny how it happens </strong>

I love how I take one step forward and 2 steps back every corner

I know where I have to go

I know my path, but am scared to walk it

I am scared
Everything in my life is a cry for help 
Someone please save me from myself right?

I am scared of myself because I know myself

but am I also lost?

I do know where to go but I also don't

I know the path
but i'm not sure if it's the right path

I do not have a guide so if I walk down this path
It would be putting full faith in me
and only me


I said I was all in
but I lied to my self

All in means all
in

My heart.
My soul.
my thoughts.
and my feelings are all invested
invested in me

I love myself and I don't have to lie
because I believe it

I can do it
I know I can
They will always doubt

"I've been destroyed and if I destroy maybe I feel ok"
